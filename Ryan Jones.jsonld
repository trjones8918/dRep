I DO talk to area experts (and other trusted peers) in order to create informed decisions. Good leaders aren't the BEST at everything. They can't possibly have all the answers. However, they CAN surround themselves with the best people. Discernment on where to receive guidance is often the superpower that makes or breaks the success of leadership. I chose to build a business on Cardano. I've been here since 2017 and seen the community come into its own. This chain's future matters to me. We employ many, many people over at NEWM. This, coupled with my ability to story tell and affectively communicate complex issues, leads me to believe I have just enough hubris to covet your voting power."
